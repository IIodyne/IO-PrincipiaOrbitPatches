# IO-PrincipiaOrbitPatches
Contains patches to make various planet pack orbits stable with Principia tested to ~5,000+ years.
Compatible with IO-AlteredOrbits.

Currently contains:

  **Stock Joolean System** - Fixes ejection of Vall, Bop, and Pol out of Joolean system; increases SMA of Vall, Tylo, Bop, and Pol, and makes Bop's orbit retrograde. ~~Values copied directly from Principia's patch.~~ Values differ from Principia's patch for better stability (Vall still tended to escape the system a few hundred years in with the original patch). New patch changes the orbital resonances to 1 : e : e<sup>2</sup> : sqrt(5)\*e<sup>2</sup> : 2\*sqrt(5)\*e<sup>2</sup>. (2 instead of sqrt(5) was used at first but Bop would leave the system after a few thousand years due to proximity to Tylo/Pol.)
    ***Necessary if installing a planet pack.***
    
  **Outer Planets Mod** - Fixes disturbances of inner Sarnus system; increases Ovok's SMA to outer system and eccentricity, and makes Ovok orbit retrograde. Values derived from the work of EnderDragneel and ryansennis.
    
  **Minor Planets Expansion** - Fixes unstable orbit of Kal; increases Kal's SMA and eccentricity to more closely resemble Namaka. Values derived from https://bit.ly/3jeKkab, with the ratio of Ki'Ki's to Hi'iaka's SMA as reference.

  **Neidon Plus** - 
  
  **Extrasolar** - 
  
  **Kcalbeloh System** - ***The wormhole around Jool will disrupt the system! It has not been adjusted in this patch. A simple increase in SMA should work fine, say 1.25-1.5x, but has not been tested nor implemented.***
