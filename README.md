# IO-PrincipiaOrbitPatches
Contains patches to make various planet pack orbits stable with Principia.
Compatible with IO-AlteredOrbits.

Currently contains:

  **Stock Joolean System** - Fixes ejection of Vall and Bop out of Joolean system; increases SMA of Vall, Tylo, and Bop, and makes Bop orbit retrograde. Values copied directly from Principia's patch.
    ***Necessary if installing a planet pack.***
    
  **Outer Planets Mod** - Fixes disturbances of inner Sarnus system; increases Ovok's SMA to outer system and eccentricity, and makes Ovok orbit retrograde. Values derived from the work of EnderDragneel and ryansennis.
    
  **Minor Planets Expansion** - Fixes unstable orbit of Kal; increases Kal's SMA and eccentricity to more closely resemble Namaka. Values derived from https://bit.ly/3jeKkab, with the ratio of Ki'Ki's to Hi'iaka's SMA as reference.
